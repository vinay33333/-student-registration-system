## üß† How I Made This Project

### 1. Planning
- Wrote out app flow (register, store in localStorage, display, edit/delete).

### 2. HTML Structure
- Made 3 pages: Home (`index.html`), Register (`registration.html`), Records (`studentData.html`).
- Linked them with identical navbars for easy movement.

### 3. Styling (Custom + Tailwind Concepts)
- Used responsive CSS and utility classes for spacing, color, and layout.

### 4. Registration Form Logic
- Client-side validation for all fields, including min/max checks.
- Prevents bad or empty input, only lets good records be stored.

### 5. Displaying & Managing Records
- Loads from localStorage with `window.onload` and shows in a sortable, filterable table.
- Includes search, edit (modal), and delete (with warning).
- Any change immediately updates localStorage.

### 6. Full Responsiveness
- All forms, buttons, tables adjust for mobile/tablet/desktop.
- Even the edit modal looks great on small screens.

### 7. Documentation & GitHub
- This well-structured README.
- Separate commits for each file.
- Code comments for all complex logic.
